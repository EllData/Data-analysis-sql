This repository contains a collection of SQL queries written for data analysis, practice, and problem-solving. The queries are based on datasets like the Oracle HR schema and other public datasets (e.g., Kaggle), and demonstrate different SQL concepts including filtering, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and more.

## Topics Covered

- Filtering and sorting
- JOIN operations (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Subqueries and nested queries
- CASE statements
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
- HR database queries
- Real-world project queries

## Purpose

This repository is part of my data analytics portfolio and reflects my skills in extracting insights from data using SQL. It will be continuously updated with new queries and use cases.
